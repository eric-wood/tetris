# Tetris...
## In your terminal!

I wanted to mess around with curses and Ruby, so I decided to write a little Tetris clone.

### TODO
* Collision detection
* Keep pieces moving down the screen even when keys are pressed
* Make things look nicer
* Scoring

### License

Eh, maybe I'll use the BSD license? I dunno.
